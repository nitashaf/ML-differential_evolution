# ML-differential_evolution
In this project, we implemented and evaluated different population-based approaches (evolutionary or swarm-based methods) for training a feedforward neural network. We compared the performance of these population-based methods with the results from backpropagation, which was used in a previous project. The task involved both classification and
regression on six datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (three for classification and three for regression). The focus of this project was on training the weights and biases of all layers using these population-based techniques on a fully connected neural network. Our experiments provided insights into the effectiveness of these methods by comparing their results in terms of accuracy and convergence. The findings showed that backpropagation consistently outperformed the population-based methods in both classification and regression tasks across all layer configurations. However, the results were mixed when it came to convergence, with varying performance across the different datasets
Note: The code has a differential evolution algorithm part, which was developed by me.
